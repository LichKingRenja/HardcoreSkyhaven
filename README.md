# HardcoreSkyhaven
A hardcore experience for the Skyblock players. Improved mobs, one life only, no healing. How long can you survive the horror?


Description
Welcome to Hardcore Skyhaven, an unforgiving skyblock experience designed for those who crave true challenge. You start with almost nothing, suspended above the endless void, where every resource must be earned and every mistake can end your run. There’s only one life, and survival demands patience, creativity, and precision.

Build complex automation systems using Create, Mekanism, and Applied Energistics 2 while fending off relentless enemies from Born in Chaos. Manage hunger, temperature, and light with mods like Spice of Life, Serene Seasons, and Hardcore Torches. Healing is scarce, and you’ll need potions or golden apples to recover from any damage.

This modpack is not for the faint of heart... It’s for players who want to master the void, automate survival, and earn every victory the hard way.

⚠️ One life. One chance. Build wisely.
